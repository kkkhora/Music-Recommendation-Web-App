Mess Is Mine,"Alternative Folk,Indie Pop,Alternative",Vance Joy,AU,"Talking like we used to do
It was always me and you
Shaken up and shipping out
Check me in and check me out

Do you like walking in the rain
When you think of love, do you think of pain
You can tell me what you see
I will choose what I believe

Hold on, darling
This body is yours, this body is yours and mine
Hold on my darling
This mess was yours, now your mess is mine

Silver Lining,Alternative,Mt. Joy,,"Up on the mountain
Caught on the rail line
Up on the mountain
Caught on the rail line

My brother, let the heart just beat
Drink your wine, smoke your weed
My brother, let the heart still beat

And wear your silver lining
Wear it close to your skin

But if it's the drugs, the women, the wine, the weed
The love that took everything I own
Just take it oh oh oh
And tell the ones you love you love them

Carried Me With You,,Brandi Carlile,US,"You're the soul who understands
The scars that made me who I am
Through the drifting sands of time
I got your back and you got mine

If you bear a heavy load
I'll be your wheels, I'll be the road
I'll see us through the thick and thin
For love and loss until the end

'Cause you carried me with you
From the highest of the peaks
To the darkness of the blue
I was just too blind to see
Like a lighthouse in a storm
You were always guiding me
Yeah, it's true
You carried me with you

Dirty Paws,Music,Of Monsters and Men,IS,"Jumping up and down the floor
My head is an animal
And once there was an animal
It had a son that mowed the lawn

The son was an OK guy
They had a pet dragonfly
The dragonfly it ran away
But it came back with a story to say

Her dirty paws and furry coat
She ran down the forest slope
The forest of talking trees
They used to sing about the birds and the bees

I Need Never Get Old,Rock,Nathaniel Rateliff & The Night Sweats,,"Can we be there
Oh, just think of the time
Thought of love so strange
Said you never knew
While I try my best
To cover our eyes
It's a common way to blame and hide the truth

I know that some will say, it matters but little babe
Ah but come on and mean it to me
I need it so bad

I needed to try
Needed to fall
I needed your love, I'm burning away

Olalla,"Folk,Contemporary Singer/Songwriter",Blanco White,,"Oh Olalla, more than a name
Rest your eyes and stay in the shade
You are hiding over the hill
In a quiet never so still

From Olalla to the city lights
Somebody told me to believe in better times
From Olalla to the city lights
Somebody told me to believe
To believe

1957,Alternative,Milo Greene,US,"Your house that sits behind me
Is covered in ivy green

The windows that we watch from
Are old and chipping at the beam

It takes me away
It takes me away
Takes me away

It takes me away
It takes me away
Takes me away

The scent you wear moves in lines
From your apartment into mine

Sedona,"Indie Rock,Alternative",Houndmouth,US,"The red sandstorm it fell
Right smack on top
Of Sedona Arabelle
When John Ford said, won't you hop on in, in a stagecoach, baby
Gonna take you for a spin, oh-woah
Woah-woah

Well hey, Little Hollywood
You're gone, but you're not forgot
You got the cash, but your credit's no good
You flipped the script, and you shot the plot
And I remember, I remember when your neon used to burn so bright and pink
A Saturday night kind of pink

Little Road,"Alternative Folk,Singer/Songwriter",Devarrow,,"Coming down
The little road
Going to go out
In the snow

Put the horse
Before the cart
Going to go out
In the dark

Holy moly
Me oh my
You're the apple
Of my eye

Cross the hill
To Johnson Straight
Goin to be back
Before midday

Boom, boom, boom
Went the shadow in the night
Boom, boom, boom
Went the shadow in my only head

Boom, boom, boom
Went the shadow in the night

Celeste,Singer/Songwriter,Ezra Vine,NZ,"I was sitting in a field of pine trees
Coaxing the words from the earth and the dirt and
I sought a muse but the words just wouldn't come
It's been a while since I saw you at New Year
Holding your breath, your eyes upon the second hand
The way you looked is still vivid to me

You're something out of a dream
Messing with my head
And I've been looking for you
Are you hiding?
'Cause I like the way you're calling to me
Your spell upon me

Family,"Music,Singer/Songwriter",Drew Holcomb & The Neighbors,,"Family, singing in the kitchen
Family, running through the yard
Family, going on vacation
Family, on the credit card

Family, all in this together
Family, we're taking a chance
Family, like birds of a feather
Family, kick off your shoes and dance

Family, on the way to the city
Family, laughing in the rain
Family, it ain't always pretty

Grow into Love,"Music,Rock",Half Moon Run,CA,"Yes I know what it means
To have six years behind us in waiting
Naught but a shadow remained
Well you took what was left worth takin ...

This has only begun
But I, I do not know if I could just
Grow into love with you
Or if you could grow too...

I have to get out of this place

Dearly Departed (feat. Esm√© Patterson),,Shakey Graves,US,"Ooh
Ooh
Ooh
Ooh

Well
You and I both know that the house is haunted
And you and I both know that the ghost is me
You used to catch me in your bed-sheets just a-rattling your chains
Well back then baby, it didn't seem so strange

You used to bite, I used to moan
But now I'm mumbling and you choke
Well I ain't so scary on my own
Tell me honey, what's a dagger without a cloak?
Well I don't know

'Cause

Either Way,Singer/Songwriter,Beta Radio,,"Oh, love of mine is this your design?
Can we not just take our time?
Turn the lights on but leave the lights low
A second chance to take it slow

Either way, I want to go
Either way, I want to go
Either way, I want to go
Either way, I want to go
Either way, I want to go

Sing the same as Solomon
It's not mathematics when two means one
Turn the lights on but leave them real low
A second chance to take it slow

Either way, I want to go
Either way, I want to go
Either way, I want to go
Either way, I want to go
Either way, I want to go

Chateau,"Alternative,Singer/Songwriter",Angus & Julia Stone,,"I don't mind if you wanna go anywhere
I'll take you there
We can go if you wanna go anywhere
I'll take you there

We can go to the Chateau Marmont
And dance in the hotel room
We can run with the headlights on
'Til we got nothing to lose

We have lifted from the ground
We go, never coming down

I don't mind if you wanna go anywhere
I'll take you there
Everyday the weekend
I'm tryin' to be your best friend
Tryin' just to figure it out
Go on and let your gun burst
Living on the outskirts
Tryin' just to figure it out

People Need A Melody,"Music,Alternative",The Head And The Heart,US,"Pick yourself up, kid
I can't bare the weight
Pick your mood up, friend
We don't have the time
When you find someone
We don't run away
Pick yourself up, kid

All those books in your head
Is that all this really was?
Just a role you play
That you could hide behind
Is it what you want?
To bury yourself away
Before your time goes
I don't want a love that holds us back
I don't want a life that I can't have

'Cause people need a melody to open their eyes
Like a key to a memory frozen in time

Hold On,Alternative,Alabama Shakes,US,"Bless my heart
Bless my soul
Didn't think I'd make it to 22 years old
There must be someone up above saying ""Come on, Brittany

You got to come on up!""
You got to hold on

Hey, you got to hold on
So, bless my heart and bless yours too

I don't know where I'm gonna go, don't what what I'm gonna do
Must be somebody up above saying ""Come on, Brittany
